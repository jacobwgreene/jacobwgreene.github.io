<h3>The Visual Rhetoric of Florida Sinkholes</h3>
	<p style="font-size: .8em">"What we desperately need is an appropriate level of shock and anxiety concerning a specific ecological trauma" <br>-Timothy Morton, <i>Hyperobjects: Philosophy and Ecology After the End of the World</i></p>
	
	
	<p>On February 28th, 2013, a sinkhole opened up beneath a man's bedroom in Seffner, FL, swallowing him in his sleep. The rarity of sinkhole fatalities, combined with the fact that the man (Jeff Bush) was the only person killed in a house of five other people, contributed to an unprecedented sense of myth and incredulity pervading the media's coverage of the sinkhole. Due to its consistent (re)circulation within the media, the Seffner sinkhole (and Florida sinkholes in general) operated as a "specific ecological trauma" for comprehending the abstract processes of global ecological disaster, or what environmental theorist Timothy Morton refers to as a "hyperobject." </p>
    <p>For my research into this phenomenon, I utilized Laurie Gries' "iconographic tracking" methodoloy in order to better understand the circulation of Florida sinkoles as hyperobjects in the wake of the 2013 Seffner sinkhole. Gries’ methodology advocates for a productive dialectic between “data hoarding” (collecting data through web and image searches) and “data mining” (analyzing this data for patterns and trends) so that the researcher’s knowledge of a given phenomenon is constantly informed by the movement of the phenomenon itself and not just the initial concerns of the researcher. According to Gries, such a methodology allows for the emergence of an image or event’s “nonlinear, divergent, and unpredictable flows.”</p>
    
    
    <p>After tracking the visual circulation of Florida sinkholes in the mainstream media from 2013-2014, I found that the media's deployment of sinkhole imagery perpetuated a rhetoric of sinkholes as isolated yet ubiquitous ecological crises. The media's emphasis on Florida sinkholes during this time period provided a "specific ecological trauma" for mediating the hyperobject "global climate change." Media theorist Richard Grusin refers to this cultural phenomenon as "premediation," or the process through which a society anticipates the affective grounds of future trauam by simulating (i.e. premediating) its experience through the mainstream media.</p>

<h3>(Re)Circulation</h3>

<p>This is an image of the sinkhole responsible for the first large spike in "sinkhole" search queries in 2010. This photograph is not only one of the most iconic and ubiquitous sinkhole images circulating online, but it is frequently referenced and appears alongside coverage of Florida sinkholes. The visual ubiquity of the Guatemala City image came to shape the circulation of Florida sinkholes.</p>

<p style="font-size: small">Photograph courtesy of The Daily Squib (2013).</p>
<p>This image appeared in a british satirical magazine on March 6th, 2013, just a week after the Seffner sinkhole. The Guatemala City sinkhole captures the aura of incredulity surrounding sinkholes as ecological phenomena, a fact which perhaps explains its appropriation as a visual mediator for an event as unbelievable as the Seffner sinkhole.</p>

<p>This appropriation even continued into the mainstraim media. Notice how this particular image of the Guatemala city sinkhole was edited in order to convey a sense of anonymity to the looming “sinkhole” beneath the Florida map. It appears as though someone attempted to erase this structure using the same soil colored layer as the image background.</p>

<h3>Hyperobjects</h3>
<p>The sinkhole images beneath the map operate as "specific ecological traumas" for the abstract dots. </p>
