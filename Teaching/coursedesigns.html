	   <h3>ENG 1131: Writing Through Augmented Reality</h3>
   </div>
	   
			<p>Compelling applications of augmented reality (AR) technology continue to surface within a variety of contexts: museums are integrating AR content into their displays, marketing campaigns are promoting AR in lieu of print or even web-based catalogs, and digital activists are leveraging AR to turn physical objects, texts, and locations into sites of critique. Writing Through Augmented Reality introduces students to the cultural, technical, and rhetorical characteristics of site-specific augmented reality applications, or AR applications that can only be experienced within the context of a specific physical location. Specifically, this course focuses on 1) the use of AR to provide supplementary information within a physical space and 2) the use of AR to subvert or critique aspects of a physical space. As such, the readings and assignments for this course focus not only on the social and cultural aspects of AR as an emerging medium, but also on the technical and rhetorical knowledge required to create our own site-specific AR applications. All of the assignments for this class will operate under a project-based learning model: students will spend the semester designing, writing, testing, and promoting a site-specific augmented reality application to be used within an area in or around campus. Among other assignments, students will write emails to potential site contacts, craft project proposals, design posters and other promotional materials, and maintain a progress blog. Screening times will be used to scaffold students’ technical knowledge of AR software and hardware so that they can create rhetorically compelling mobile AR applications. No prior coding or software experience is required; however, students should display a sense self-motivated interest in developing their abilities to learn and operate new technologies. </p>

			<p>This course focuses on the role of the “screen” as a material artifact vital to the rhetorical complexity of 21st century writing. Drawing from technology and media theorists, students analyze the role of a variety of digital technologies within our culture including augmented reality software, natural/kinetic user interfaces, and mobile/ubiquitous computing, among others. In addition to these “inside” components of the screen (software, apps, websites, etc.) students also focus on its “outside” effects by looking at its biological and social impact on areas such as the human brain, education, foreign labor, the mainstream media, protests, and international revolutions. The course assignments focus on enhancing students’ ability to craft rhetorically effective writing. Moreover, due to the constantly shifting definitions of what constitutes “writing” in our screen saturated culture, students will work within the new modes and genres that have emerged alongside the proliferation of the screen, such as tweets, vines, videos, Facebook posts, memes, and blogs, among others. In so doing, students will not only gain greater acuity in operating within a variety of rhetorical situations but also gain a more nuanced understanding of the strategic and dispersed nature of digital writing.</p>
