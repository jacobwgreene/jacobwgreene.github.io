   </div>
	   
			<p>Writing Through Media: Augmented Reality focuses on the emergence of augmented reality technologies (Google Glass, Microsoft Kinect, Hololens, etc.), exploring their technical, biological, and cultural impact on contemporary society. For the capstone project, students learn how to build their own augmented reality experiences and incorporate rhetorically aware, multimodal content. In taking an analytical as well as applied approach to the study of augmented reality, students gain a clearer understanding of how human experience of “reality” has always been “augmented” in some sense, from the development of language and early writing systems to the most cutting edge technologies of today.</p>	
	  
	   
	
	   <a href="WritingAboutScreens.docx"><h3>ENC 1145: Writing About Screens</h3></a>
   
	   
			<p>This course focuses on the role of the “screen” as a material artifact vital to the rhetorical complexity of 21st century writing. Drawing from technology and media theorists, students analyze the role of a variety of digital technologies within our culture including augmented reality software, natural/kinetic user interfaces, and mobile/ubiquitous computing, among others. In addition to these “inside” components of the screen (software, apps, websites, etc.) students also focus on its “outside” effects by looking at its biological and social impact on areas such as the human brain, education, foreign labor, the mainstream media, protests, and international revolutions. The course assignments focus on enhancing students’ ability to craft rhetorically effective writing. Moreover, due to the constantly shifting definitions of what constitutes “writing” in our screen saturated culture, students will work within the new modes and genres that have emerged alongside the proliferation of the screen, such as tweets, vines, videos, Facebook posts, memes, and blogs, among others. In so doing, students will not only gain greater acuity in operating within a variety of rhetorical situations but also gain a more nuanced understanding of the strategic and dispersed nature of digital writing.</p>
