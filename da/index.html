							<h2>Thursday Panel</h2>
							<p>Dr. Lori Emerson and Dr. Alexander Reid will be delivering talks on the topic of digital materiality on Thursday March 30th from 12pm-4pm in the UF Informatics Institute located in the Computer, Information, Science and Engineering (CISE) building adjacent to Marston Science Library.</p>

							<h3>"Media Archaeology: From Interface to Undersea Cable" &mdash; Lori Emerson</h3>

							<blockquote>Dr. Emerson's talk will explore the past, present and philosophy of the Media Archaeology Lab as well as the connections between the lab, the field of media archaeology, and her earlier work on interfaces along with her present work on pre-Internet artist networks.</blockquote>

							 <h3>"Composing with Deliberate Speed: Writing Humanity's Future Sensorium" &mdash; Alexander Reid</h3>

							 <blockquote>Dr. Reid's talk focuses on how the speed and density of information flows in contemporary digital media ecology regularly exceed any conscious human capacity to process and deliberate media. Mark Hansen refers to this as a “feed-forward” environment where digital machines measure our bodies, texts, and interactions with the digital world and the present us with a customized encounter with the media ecology produced through algorithmic procedures running faster than we can see. As Hansen notes, “with their sophisticated methods for targeting the infrastructural elements that inform our responses, today’s data and culture industries are increasingly able simply to cut our conscious deliberation out of the loop” (Feed Forward, 58). If we are to be free-willed, rational beings capable of ethical behavior, the capacity to deliberate and to be deliberate, to have intent, would appear to be necessary. Without such capacities, how is democracy possible? Dr. Reid investigates these questions drawing on Manual DeLanda’s assemblage theory and Bruno Latour’s second empiricism and examine specific technologies from the commonplace smartphone app to experimental technologies designed to expand the sensorium.</blockquote>

							<h2>Friday Workshop</h2>
							<p>On Friday March 31st, Dr. Trettien will be leading a digital media workshop in the Scott Nygren Studio located in Library West from 9am-12pm.</p>
							<h3>"The Book Machine: From Print to Digital Materiality" &mdash; Whitney Trettien</h3>	
							<blockquote>From the rotating astronomical discs in sixteenth-century books to pop-ups and punch-card computing, paper has always activated human agency. In this workshop, we investigate electronic touchscreens and digital design alongside what Johanna Drucker describes as the "phenomenal codex": the productive entanglement of meaning and matter catalyzed with each fold, flip, and spin of a book's pages. This is a fundamentally feminist project. By blurring the conceptual boundaries between print and digital technologies, between paper and circuits, our work together will bring into view an alternative history of interactive media design, one that decenters narratives of progress and listens for difference and resistance. The workshop will include a guided tour through pre-, proto- and post-electronic materialities, as well as a hands-on experiment designing a hybrid print/digital book.</blockquote>
