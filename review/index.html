								<blockquote>"To engage with digital content, in this paradigm, does not require disengagement from one's surroundings; indeed, enhancing one's perceptual and cognitive experience of the spatiotemporal <strong>here and now</strong> is precisely the ideal that orients AR." &mdash; Morey & Tinnell, 7</blockquote>
								<p><i>Augmented Reality: Innovative Perspectives Across Art, Industry, and Academia</i> offers an in-depth examination of the cultural emergence of “augmented reality” (AR) technology. The authors in the collection outline the rhetorical implications of AR for a variety of disciplines and industries, from writing studies and visual rhetoric to digital marketing and historical interpretation. One of Morey and Tinnell’s main arguments throughout Augmented Reality is that AR technologies “support new writing and design spaces” (9). Thus, they offer the reader not only information <em>about</em> AR but a <em>demonstration</em> of how AR might be incorporated into the design of print collection. Using the free mobile AR application Aurasma, readers can scan augmented pages throughout the book to access additional multimedia “overlays” such as film clips and interviews. For the most part, the AR overlays operate as digital supplements to the book’s printed material, and the main content of the collection can be accessed without downloading the Aurasma app.</p>
								<p>The collection is separated into three sections: articles, interviews, and artworks. “Part 1: Scholarly Articles” brings together scholars from fields such as composition, rhetorical theory, comics studies, and media studies. This section brings valuable interdisciplinary breadth to the academic discussions taking place about the potential of AR.  “Part 2: Interviews” signals this collection's unique approach to its investigation of an emerging writing technology in recognizing that critical investigations of new media require a range of voices, including non-academic experts from the technology industry. Thus, this section provides six compelling interviews with leading experts in the fields of computer science, digital humanities, and mobile AR development. The final section, “Part 3: Artwork,” builds upon the theoretical (Part 1) and technical (Part 2) foci of the previous sections by exhibiting augmented reality artworks from digital artists from across the world. This section proves to be the most innovative in terms of design in that each artwork can be accessed within the pages of the book itself simply by scanning the pages with the Aurasma app.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Part 1</h2>
								<span class="image main"></span>
								<p>Part 1 features ten chapters from scholars working out of digital rhetoric and media studies. The authors cover a range of topics and areas of concern that are being (or will be) impacted by the development of AR technologies, such as zoo exhibit design, comic book design, digital memory, rhetorical theory, and much more. Although the scholarly contributors in part 1 take a variety of approaches to AR, they mostly seem to be in agreement on the idea that AR’s key affordance as a writing technology is its ability to interact in meaningful ways with the user’s physical surroundings, whether these surroundings are a general location or a specific object/text.. Moreover, they mostly seem to agree that “augmented reality” is not reducible to any particular concept or technological assemblage. Rather, AR is a broader socio-cultural phenomenon emerging through a networked ecology of ideas, technologies, and representations.</p>

								<h3>Augmented Space</h3>

								<p>Many of the contributors approach AR in terms of how it changes how the user interacts within physical locations. In the opening chapter of part 1, Brett Oppegaard offers readers a methodology for designing location-aware AR experiences. Drawing upon his work designing AR experiences for the National Parks, Oppegard describes how AR technologies, if they are going to become a form of mainstream media, must not only pursue technical alignment (i.e. the verisimilitude between digital and physical components of the application) but also rhetorical alignment. Oppegaard’s major contribution to theorizing AR as a design practice comes in his categorization of rhetorical alignment into three tiers: location, spatial, and contextual. Tier 1 alignment (location) focuses on the degree to which the digital information aligns with the rhetoric of the space itself. Tier 2 alignment (spatial) refers to the ability of the AR application to connect the user to physical spaces and objects outside of the user’s immediate, conscious concerns. Lastly, Tier 3 alignment (contextual) refers to how the AR experience delivers context-specific and/or personalized information to the user. Oppegard moves the conversation forward in terms of AR criticism by offering a more precise framework that other scholars, artists, and designers can draw upon in developing and evaluating location-aware AR experiences. In chapter 9, “SAZoo-AR, Ethea, and Computer Vision,” Steve Holmes provides a detailed analysis of an interactive augmented reality game created for use within the San Antonio Zoo. The application allows users to scan augmented targets throughout the park to access 3D animations and informational quizzes related to nearby exhibits. Holmes rightly critiques the zoo’s utopian claims that AR technology in and of itself offers a dramatically improved learning experience inaccessible through non-AR media like books and films. Holmes’ chapter offers a good corrective to digital evangelists who preach of AR as a “revolutionary” technology in itself without close consideration of the content (physical and digital) of specific applications. Through his analysis of the SAZoo-AR app, Holmes demonstrates that rhetorical analyses of AR experiences must account for how these apps are realized through emergent interactions with actual users in real places.</p>

								<p>Similarly, chapters 5, “Life through the Screen: Location-Based Information and the Personalization of Space,” and 10, “When Geolocation meets Visualization,” outline the potential effects and affordances offered by mobile AR technologies that are capable of linking digital texts to specific physical locations. In chapter 5, Jordan Frith discusses the potential effects of AR interfaces on how we conceive of (and interact with) public spaces. Frith points out that the continued development of AR as an everyday interface for public interaction may contribute to a further perpetuation of the “filter bubble” that currently plagues online discourses. Frith cautions that the “homophily” (i.e. the tendency of people in similar socio-cultural strata to cluster together) of public life could be accelerated if these personalization algorithms overtake our experiences of physical public spaces. In chapter 10, Jason Farman describes how geolocative AR applications are redefining taken-for-granted concepts like “space” by demonstrating how space is not a thing to be abstracted but rather something we embody, practice, and produce. In part, Farman claims AR participates in a further collapsing of the false dichotomy between the real and the virtual by exposing the degree to which the “reality” of a place is composed of a diverse array of potential rhetorical actants and interpretations. Farman describes how maps are being redefined in a mobile media era in which users participate in both the creation and use of digital maps for a variety of purposes (e.g. finding a restaurant, marking themselves “safe” during a crisis, etc.). Those interested in more in-depth studies of the relationship between mobile media and spatial rhetorics should also consult Farman’s edited collection <i>The Mobile Story: Narrative Practice with Locative Technologies</i> as well as Jordan Frith’s recent book <i>Smartphones as Locative Media</i>.</p>

								<h3>Augmented Culture</h3>

								<p>Other contributors in section 1 interrogate AR as a pop-culture phenomenon within comics, AR product marketing, and science-fiction media. In Chapter 3:,“Potential Panels: Toward a Theory of Augmented Comics,” Jason Helms provides a succinct summary of the current state of AR within comics. For the most part, Helms is disappointed in the current state of AR comics, noting that most mainstream uses (e.g. “Marvel AR”) use AR more as a marketing gimmick than a medium for enhancing the reading experience. As an alternative, Helms offers several potential examples for how AR might be integrated into print comics, the most promising of which is Helms idea of post-publication augmentations that could be created by comics scholars and/or readers as a way to bring online conversations about the comic onto specific pages and panels (61-2). In Chapter 4: “‘Sergey Brin is Batman:’ Google Glass and the Rhetoric of Adoption in Popular Culture,” Isabel Pedersen and Douglas Trueman extend this section’s cultural analysis of AR into a case-study of media representations of Google Glass, focusing specifically on its entanglement with the ethos of Google’s founder, Sergey Brin. For Pedersen and Trueman, Google Glass is more than “a marketing phenomenon heralding a technological prototype;” it is a “rhetorical instigator” for an entirely new era of human computer interaction (68). Following a meme that surfaced in October 2011, they point out that the rhetoric of Glass is tied up with mythos of Sergey Brin as a “Batman” figure (i.e. a brooding business man working tirelessly and secretively to save the world). They note that Brin is more Batman than Tony Stark: he is not a quirky genius inventor but rather a savvy playboy who directs the development of technology for a broader social good. Overall, Pedersen and Trueman provide a compelling, well-researched analysis of the emergence of Glass as a cultural icon of AR, demonstrating that media representations of a new technology re influential to how a society comes to perceive it. Lastly, Joseph P. Weakland’s chapter “‘Augpunk’: Imagining Alternative Futures for Augmented Reality through Science Fiction,”provides an overview of AR representations within science fiction (SF) literature and film. Specifically, Weakland rightly points to the SF origins of AR as a technology for “rewriting public space” and “forming communities through locative art” (105, 109).Through a close analysis of Tim Maughan’s Paintwork series, Weakland describes how AR can function as a kind of digital graffiti by providing cultural and political dissidents a means of appropriating public texts and spaces as a platform for counter-public discourse. As such, Weakland’s chapter establishes a useful framework for theorizing the rhetorical function of the AR artworks discussed in Part 3 of the collection.</p>

								<h3>Augmented Rhetorics</h3>

								<p>Chapters 7 and 8 provide a compelling theoretical examination of AR as a philosophical and rhetorical phenomenon. In Chapter 7, “Gathering Memories with Augmented Reality,” Jason Kalin discusses the relationship between AR and rhetorical memory. Kalin writes that “memory and technologies of memory help disclose new exigencies in and of reality, thus creating the possibility of new worlds to inhabit” (121). For Kalin, AR technologies alter the function of memory by drawing the user’s attention toward the “ever-shifting exigencies” of her immediate surroundings. Moreover, Kalin points out that AR technology allows for an approach to memory less as a thing to be retained and recalled and more of as a place to be inhabited (121). Kalin draws upon two central metaphors within rhetorical theory for thinking about augmented memory: network and ambience. Kalin points to how mobile AR applications like Layar work as augmented memory by taking existing digital texts (e.g. tweets) and attaching them to physical spaces. Kalin’s article takes a meandering, personal approach to digital memory by following serendipitous encounters via locative media apps like WikipediaWorld and HistoryPin, which provides information about the user’s immediate surroundings. One of Kalin’s central claims is that memory becomes ambient as it is dispersed into material spaces of everyday life, thereby destabilizing the subject-object dichotomy of reductive theories of rhetorical memory. AR renders memory as temporary and fleeting; the tweets and instagram pics that Kalin accesses along the streets of Chicago are not stable items existing in a storehouse to be recalled later. Rather, they will dissolve as other digital augmented texts take their place according to the shifting kairos of specific places. In chapter 8, “The Dream Deferred: Augmented Reality as Rhetorical Realism,” Scot Barnett explores how augmented reality allows us to re-envision the relationship between reality and language. Similar to language, argues Barnett, rhetorics surrounding AR and ubicomp construe the computer as a barrier to our interactions with reality. Thus, AR, like rhetoric, becomes a barrier to reality “in itself” while also (paradoxically) functioning as window onto an unmediated view of reality. Barnett points out that, much like attempts at rhetorically unadorned “universal languages,” AR thus becomes defined as a medium that attempts to erase its presence through the very act of mediation: “For the Tagwhat user, language is no mere intentional or representational act (it is not only epistemological, in other words); it is, instead, what is speaking at a given time and place, what stems from world and is the composite of meaning and matter” (152). Barnett claims that AR reveals to us how language operates outside of primarily human concerns as it is generated alongside and through nonhuman objects and environments.</p>

								<p>The chapters in this section present a well-rounded exploration of the theories, methodologies, and rhetorics associated with AR technology at this current cultural moment. As John Tinnell notes, writing about new and emerging technologies can be akin to “playing the stockmarket” in the sense that technological innovation and cultural uptake often occurs faster than the pace of scholarly inquiry (“Grammatization,” 133). Overall, the contributors in Part 1 do a nice job of drawing out broader rhetorical implications of their analyses of contemporary AR technologies that are sure to be of value to AR researchers and designers for years to come.</p>
