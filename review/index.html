								<blockquote>"To engage with digital content, in this paradigm, does not require disengagement from one's surroundings; indeed, enhancing one's perceptual and cognitive experience of the spatiotemporal <strong>here and now</strong> is precisely the ideal that orients AR." &mdash; Morey & Tinnell, 7</blockquote>
								<p><i>Augmented Reality: Innovative Perspectives Across Art, Industry, and Academia</i> offers an in-depth examination of the cultural emergence of “augmented reality” (AR) technology. The authors in the collection outline the rhetorical implications of AR for a variety of disciplines and industries, from writing studies and visual rhetoric to digital marketing and historical interpretation. One of Morey and Tinnell’s main arguments throughout Augmented Reality is that AR technologies “support new writing and design spaces” (9). Thus, they offer the reader not only information <em>about</em> AR but a <em>demonstration</em> of how AR might be incorporated into the design of print collection. Using the free mobile AR application Aurasma, readers can scan augmented pages throughout the book to access additional multimedia “overlays” such as film clips and interviews. For the most part, the AR overlays operate as digital supplements to the book’s printed material, and the main content of the collection can be accessed without downloading the Aurasma app.</p>
								<p>The collection is separated into three sections: articles, interviews, and artworks. “Part 1: Scholarly Articles” brings together scholars from fields such as composition, rhetorical theory, comics studies, and media studies. This section brings valuable interdisciplinary breadth to the academic discussions taking place about the potential of AR.  “Part 2: Interviews” signals this collection's unique approach to its investigation of an emerging writing technology in recognizing that critical investigations of new media require a range of voices, including non-academic experts from the technology industry. Thus, this section provides six compelling interviews with leading experts in the fields of computer science, digital humanities, and mobile AR development. The final section, “Part 3: Artwork,” builds upon the theoretical (Part 1) and technical (Part 2) foci of the previous sections by exhibiting augmented reality artworks from digital artists from across the world. This section proves to be the most innovative in terms of design in that each artwork can be accessed within the pages of the book itself simply by scanning the pages with the Aurasma app.</p>
