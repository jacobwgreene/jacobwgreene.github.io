                  <h3>ENG 1131 Writing through Media: Augmented Reality</h3>
                  <p><a href="files/ENG1131_Greene.docx">Download Syllabus</a></p>
                  <p>Compelling applications of augmented reality (AR) technology continue to surface within a variety of rhetorical contexts: museums are integrating AR content into displays, marketers are promoting AR</a> in lieu of print or even web-based catalogs, and digital activists are leveraging AR to transform physical objects, texts, images, and locations into sites of critique. Writing Through Augmented Reality introduces students to the cultural, technical, and rhetorical characteristics of site-specific augmented reality applications, or AR applications that can only be experienced within the context of a specific physical location. Specifically, this course focuses on 1) the use of AR to provide supplementary information within a physical space and 2) the use of AR to subvert or critique aspects of a physical space. As such, the readings and assignments for this course focus not only on the social and cultural aspects of AR as an emerging medium, but also on the technical and rhetorical knowledge required to create our own site-specific AR applications. All of the assignments for this class will operate under a project-based learning model: students will spend the semester designing, coding, testing, and promoting a site-specific augmented reality application to be used within an area in or around campus. Among other assignments, students will write emails to potential site contacts, craft project proposals, design posters and other promotional materials, and maintain a progress blog. No prior coding or software experience is required; however, students should display a sense self-motivated interest in developing their abilities to learn and operate new technologies.</p>

Students will isolate a particular company, organization, individual, event, or social/cultural phenomenon and create an augmented reality critique using Aurasma that re-purposes the overt rhetorical message of any images, texts, places, or objects associated with it. Students will draw upon the material from their research papers to create hyperlinked text, audio overlays, and short videos to upload to Aurasma.

                  <p><a href="files/ENC1145_Greene.docx">Download Syllabus</a></p>
                  <p>This course focuses on the role of the “screen” as a material artifact vital to the rhetorical complexity of 21st century writing. Drawing from technology, digital rhetoric, and media theorists, students will analyze the role of a variety of digital technologies within our culture, including augmented/virtual reality, natural/kinetic user interfaces, and mobile/ubiquitous computing, among others. In addition to these “inside” components of screens (software, apps, websites, etc.) students will also focus on their “outside” effects by looking at the biological and social impact of mobile computing on areas such as the human brain, education, foreign labor, journalism, protests, and political revolutions. The course assignments focus on enhancing students’ ability to craft rhetorically effective writing. However, due to the constantly shifting definitions of what constitutes “writing” in a screen-saturated culture, students will work within the new modes and genres that have emerged alongside the proliferation of mobile writing technologies, such as tweets, vines, videos, Facebook posts, memes, and blogs, among others. In so doing, students will not only gain greater acuity in operating within a variety of rhetorical modes and genres, but also a more nuanced understanding of the strategic, dispersed nature of digital writing.</p>

                          Write an online technology article evaluating the potential of an unreleased and/or fictional screen-based technology. This could be a new physical device; a new kind of software or operating system; or even a technology from a movie, book, or television show. For example, you might provide a brief overview of <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/realsense-overview.html" target="_blank">Intel's new Real Sense technology</a> and use the product information from Intel's website to critically evaluate the claims that Intel makes about its potential to revolutionize our everyday interactions with the desktop computer interface. As you speculate on the future potential of your technology, be sure to explain the reasoning behind your evaluations. Consider the following questions as you formulate your response:
                          <p>
                            <ul>
                              <li>What social and cultural conditions guarantee that this technology will (or will not) become integrated into our every day lives?</li>
                              <li>Is this technology merely a gimmick? If so, why? What is a gimmick?</li>
                              <li>Can you think of any past technologies which faced criticism yet still became integrated into society? Conversely, are there any past technologies that did not live up to the hype surrounding them? Use these examples to support your evaluation.</li>

                          <p>The purpose of this assignment is to practice writing one of the most popular new media genres of the twenty first century: the tweet. In order to do so, you must attend and live-tweet a public event, preferably one related to the focus of your screen story video. However, I am open to other events. Just make sure you send me a link to the event and I have approved it before you go. For example, if your screen story focuses on the impact of screens within marketing and advertising, you might attend a conference or a lecture by a professional in your field. If you are having trouble finding an event, ask some professors from your department if there are any upcoming events at the university they would recommend. If you do not know any of the professors from your field/major, this would be a great opportunity to establish a professional relationship with one of them and share your own passion/interest for your field of study.</p> <p>If you have access to a live video and audio stream of the event, then you do not have to be physically present at the event location. Make sure that you give yourself ample time to find an appropriate event before the assignment due date. You will be required to turn in a flyer or link to a website in order to verify your event. Be sure to use the #hashtag associated with your event so that other attendees can see your tweets.</p> <p>When composing your tweets, make sure that your style not only utilizes the medium you are working with (pictures, links, etc.) but also aligns with the rhetorical style of other tweets affiliated with the event. For example, if you are at a sporting event or performance of some kind, you might want to include more pictures than if you were merely watching a lecture, in which you might include more tweets with relevant links to the speaker's presentation. It might be wise to wait a few minutes prior to tweeting so that you can gauge the rhetorical style of the tweets circulating about your event. One of the key rhetorical features of Twitter is the re-tweet function, so be sure to craft your tweets with circulation in mind. Consider the following questions as you tweet: </p>
                          <p>
                            <ul>
                              <li>What kind images or links might other event attendees want to see?</li>
                              <li>What about people not present for the event?</li>
                              <li>Are there any other people live-tweeting that you could interact with through replies?</li>      
                            </ul>
                          </p>
                          Here are some helpful links with tips about live-tweeting. Make sure you take a look a look at each and follow the appropriate advice for your particular event:
                          <p>
                            <ul>
                              <li><a href="http://mashable.com/2014/07/16/how-to-live-tweet/" target="_blank">Lance Ulanoff- "How I Gained 68,000 Followers by Live-Tweeting"</a></li>

                            </ul>
                          </p>
                          Although I do not have a specific number of tweets that you need to compose during your event, you should tweet around every 3-5 minutes.

                          <p>Create a 3-5 minute YouTube video that depicts the fictionalized journey of an electronic screen (phone, television, laptop, etc.) as it impacts a particular aspect of society. Example areas can be drawn from different sections of the course, such as education, mass media, electronic waste, childhood development, and social media rhetorics, among many others. Although it is not required, I would encourage you to choose a sector of society that is related to your field of study (e.g. medicine, business, sports management,  advertising, etc.).</p> <p>For example, if you created your screen story around the issue of e-waste, you might trace the manufacturing, distribution, advertising/marketing process of a device you use on a daily basis (such as your phone). You would need to gather research related to the materials (minerals, components, etc.) within the device and note the conditions under which it was produced. You might also include an ending that shows the “death” (recycled, etc.) of the device. As another example, if your sector of society was “education,” you might follow a day in the life of a typical student as you portray sources from your bibliography which discuss changes within education brought about by the internet, computers, etc. to the everyday life of students and the future changes they might bring.</p> <p>In either case, you need to creatively integrate your annotated bibliography sources into your video in some way. You can do this through text, narration, or some other means. However, because the ultimate goal of this assignment is to put your videos into circulation, your video should still contain compelling and rhetorically effective content and not merely list a series of disconnected facts and statistics from your research. Critically evaluate appropriate rhetorical strategies for the audience you are attempting to reach (e.g. students, general public, parents, sports fans, etc.). Consult the Screen Story Rationale assignment before you plan and create your video.</p><p>The form of your video will depend upon the particular discourse community in which you will be attempting to circulate it. For example, if you were focusing on education, you might consider how your video will relate to both parents and students, and perhaps even narrow your scope by grade level to focus on elementary and pre-school education. In creating your content, utilize the expansive rhetorical options available within this medium (audio, still images, moving, images) in order to create a compelling video. Feel free to use original footage, images, sound and/or media collected online. However, if you are using copyrighted material, make sure it aligns with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/yt/copyright/fair-use.html#yt-copyright-resources" target="_blank">YouTube's fair use policy</a>. Other information about using non-original footage in online videos can be found at the <a href="http://cmsimpact.org/code/code-best-practices-fair-use-online-video/#five" target="_blank">Center for Media and Social Impact</a>. You can also search <a href="http://search.creativecommons.org/" target="_blank">Creative Commons</a> for non-restricted images and video.</p><p>Learning how to craft effective search queries for online tutorials is one of the most undervalued skills of writing in a digital age. Although we will only be covering some basic technical knowledge necessary to make your video, do not let this discourage you from incorporating other techniques or skills you learn on your own from other video tutorials. As you create your video, think first about what it is that you want to do (add a title, crop a video, add subtitles, etc.) and then search online for tutorials that explain how to do it. This is a much more efficient method than emailing me with your question (which I would simply Google anyway) or waiting until class to ask me. For specific questions, Google and YouTube are really helpful; however, if you are wanting to do more advanced techniques and/or just want an overall introduction to your editing software, I would recommend <a
                          href="https://www.lynda.com/signin?redirectTo=member.aspx">Lynda.com</a>, a site available for free through UF that I have found extremely useful for my own multimedia projects. Whenever searching online for a particular thing that you want to do, be sure to include the software name in all of your search queries (e.g. "create credits in Adobe Premiere").</p><p>If you are stuck for ideas about how to make your video, browse the Issues page of <a href="http://jump.dwrl.utexas.edu/">The JUMP (Journal of Undergraduate Multimedia Projects)</a>. I would also encourage you to consider <a href="http://jump.dwrl.utexas.edu/node/1">submitting your video to The JUMP</a> at the end of the semester. Publications make a great addition to the resume and show that you are an engaged and driven student.</p>

                  <p><a href="files/ENC3310_Greene.docx">Download Syllabus</a></p>
                  <p>The Greek philosopher Aristotle defined rhetoric as “the ability to discern the available means of persuasion in any given case.” For Aristotle, the practice “persuasion” was limited to a very narrow set of practices carried out by an even more narrow set of individuals: wealthy male statesmen giving speeches to one another. However, Aristotle’s definition is still useful in that it encourages us to think about rhetoric as not only something that we do (i.e. persuading) but also something that we can analyze as an object of inquiry. Today, our “available means of persuasion” have evolved to encompass a much larger set of practices, contexts, technologies, and cultures. Specifically, the unprecedented growth of digital media over the last two decades has had a profound impact on the way that we act, think, read, and argue. This course explores the rhetorical implications of this shift to digital writing. In this class, students will produce and analyze texts in a variety of media (blogs, Facebook posts, tweets, vines, videos, etc.).</p>

                           Track down an argument that you believe to be utter nonsense and explain the rhetorical techniques and contexts that convince people to “buy” this argument. The purpose of this assignment is to think about how "arguments" are not always tied to a specific individual, text, or event, but rather circulate within and across online networks as they take on a life of their own. In locating an argument, think about it in terms of a specific thesis statement (e.g. "global warming is a hoax"), and then locate online sources in support of this statement. In researching your argument, don’t rely on a single source or media. Search for occurrences of this argument in a variety of places, such as newspaper articles, news broadcasts, YouTube videos, memes, tweets, FB posts, etc. In total, you should gather at least 7-8 primary sources&mdash;all related to the same overall argument&mdash;that you will analyze for this assignment.

                           <p>In Ancient Greece, teachers of rhetoric would travel from polis to polis offering their expertise in oratory and argumentation in exchange for money. Unlike the philosopher Plato, who advocated for dialectic, or productive discourse in search of a shared, general truth, the sophists taught rhetoric with little concern for such lofty philosophical aims. One of the most prominent sophists, Gorgias, was famous for his practice of “dissoi logoi,” or the ability to argue both sides of an argument in order to demonstrate his rhetorical prowess to his students and potential customers.</p> <p>For this assignment, you will enact a modern-day dissoi logoi (or dissoi blogoi, if you will) by writing from the perspective of two antagonistic blogging personas that you create in response to a controversial public issue. Using these personas, which you will design fake accounts for through Google’s free blogging platform, you will write four blog posts (two per account at 500 words apiece) in an online, back-and-forth rhetorical battle. Feel free to choose any public issue to argue about. The only requirement is that the issue is debatable and that you can find online sources to support both sides.</p><p><b>Extra Credit:</b>Use blogger’s comments function to create a mini-back and forth on at least two of your posts.</p>

                           <p>We tend to think of writing an argument as the pursuit of a one-sided, rationally-motivated claim supported by empirical evidence. Although this is certainly true for many arguments (particular those that spark controversy in online spaces), this is not always the case. In fact, many of the most compelling, well-written arguments are the exact opposite: wandering, personal excursions into the multi-faceted complexity of an issue or idea supported by personal or anecdotal evidence.</p> <p>Using example personal essays and other writing guides, students will “essay” an argument about their personal experience(s) of a specific issue, event, person, object, or space. The goal of this assignment is not to produce an airtight, rational argument, but rather to use writing as a tool for opening up (rather than closing off) new perspectives and ideas about this issue, event, person, or space.</p><p><b>Extra Credit:</b> Adapt a portion of your essay to one of the emerging new media genres we have discussed and used this semester (tweets, vines, etc.).</p>

                  <p>We use expository writing techniques on a daily basis: we compare and contrast different ideas, we link causes to effects, and we describe problems and offer solutions. Such organizational choices are rhetorical; we choose certain organizational structures over others in order to persuade our audiences to view a situation or concept in a particular way. However, the media and genres of expository writing are beginning to evolve alongside new digital technologies such as smartphones and tablets. Specifically, the recent advent of "podcasting" offers writers a new, engaging genre through which to create and circulate their writing as audio texts. As such, this course explores the impact of “aural media” —podcasts, location-based audio tours, etc.—on expository writing. Course readings (and listenings) discuss the rhetorical affordances of aural media while at the same time serving as models of effective exposition. Course assignments provide students with opportunities to demonstrate expository writing techniques through both print and aural media. </p>
