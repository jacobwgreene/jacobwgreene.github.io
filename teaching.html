                  <h3>Writing through Augmented Reality</h3>
                  <p>Compelling applications of augmented reality (AR) technology continue to surface within a variety of rhetorical contexts: <a href="#" target="_blank">museums are integrating AR content</a> into displays, <a href="#" target="_blank">marketers are promoting AR</a> in lieu of print or even web-based catalogs, and <a href="#" target="_blank">digital activists are leveraging AR</a> to transform physical objects, texts, images, and locations into sites of critique. Writing Through Augmented Reality introduces students to the cultural, technical, and rhetorical characteristics of site-specific augmented reality applications, or AR applications that can only be experienced within the context of a specific physical location. Specifically, this course focuses on 1) the use of AR to provide supplementary information within a physical space and 2) the use of AR to subvert or critique aspects of a physical space. As such, the readings and assignments for this course focus not only on the social and cultural aspects of AR as an emerging medium, but also on the technical and rhetorical knowledge required to create our own site-specific AR applications. All of the assignments for this class will operate under a project-based learning model: students will spend the semester designing, coding, testing, and promoting a site-specific augmented reality application to be used within an area in or around campus. Among other assignments, students will write emails to potential site contacts, craft project proposals, design posters and other promotional materials, and maintain a progress blog. No prior coding or software experience is required; however, students should display a sense self-motivated interest in developing their abilities to learn and operate new technologies.</p>

                  <h3>Writing About Screens</h3>
                  <p>This course focuses on the role of the “screen” as a material artifact vital to the rhetorical complexity of 21st century writing. Drawing from technology, digital rhetoric, and media theorists, students will analyze the role of a variety of digital technologies within our culture, including augmented/virtual reality, natural/kinetic user interfaces, and mobile/ubiquitous computing, among others. In addition to these “inside” components of screens (software, apps, websites, etc.) students will also focus on their “outside” effects by looking at the biological and social impact of mobile computing on areas such as the human brain, education, foreign labor, journalism, protests, and political revolutions. The course assignments focus on enhancing students’ ability to craft rhetorically effective writing. However, due to the constantly shifting definitions of what constitutes “writing” in a screen-saturated culture, students will work within the new modes and genres that have emerged alongside the proliferation of mobile writing technologies, such as tweets, vines, videos, Facebook posts, memes, and blogs, among others. In so doing, students will not only gain greater acuity in operating within a variety of rhetorical modes and genres, but also a more nuanced understanding of the strategic, dispersed nature of digital writing.</p>

                  <h3>Argumentative Writing and Digital Rhetoric</h3>
                  <p>The ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle defined rhetoric as “the ability to discern the available means of persuasion in any given case.” For Aristotle, the practice “persuasion” was limited to a very narrow set of practices carried out by an even more narrow set of individuals: wealthy male statesmen giving speeches to one another. However, Aristotle’s definition is still useful in that it encourages us to think about rhetoric as not only something that we do (i.e. persuading) but also something that we can analyze as an object of inquiry. Today, our “available means of persuasion” have evolved to encompass a much larger set of practices, contexts, technologies, and cultures. Specifically, the unprecedented growth of digital media over the last two decades has had a profound impact on the way that we act, think, read, and argue. This course explores the rhetorical implications of this shift to digital writing. In this class, students will produce and analyze texts in a variety of media (blogs, Facebook posts, tweets, vines, videos, etc.).</p>
